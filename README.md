#Rubito

## What's rubito?

Rubito is a programming language written in Ruby and inspired by Ruby, Crystal and Python. It's aimed for simplicity and intuitivity. Rubito programs can be executed from (both rubito itself and executable files(.rbt/.rbtx/.rt/.rtx)).

## When it's out?

It should be out pretty soon.

## But wait, where should I edit the rubito code?

I'll be happy to receive help on writing syntax highlighters/extensions to modern IDEs and/or text editors.
